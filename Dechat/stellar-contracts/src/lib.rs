/// The `FiatBridge` contract manages cross-chain fiat/crypto liquidity bridging on Stellar
/// using Soroban. It provides high-assurance deposit and withdrawal vaults, multi-signer
/// governance, rolling volume limits, oracle price validation, and timelocked upgrades.
///
/// ## Overflow Prevention Architecture
/// The contract enforces deterministic arithmetic safety throughout its lifecycle:
/// - **Zero Implicit Wrapping**: Release builds enforce `overflow-checks = true`.
/// - **Explicit Error Propagation**: Uses [`checked_add`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.i128.html#method.checked_add)
///   and [`checked_sub`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.i128.html#method.checked_sub) on financial
///   accumulators, returning typed errors ([`Error::Overflow`], [`Error::InternalError`]) rather than panicking.
/// - **Safe Fixed-Point Scaling**: Decimal operations delegate to [`crate::math::checked_mul_div_floor`] /
///   [`crate::math::checked_mul_div_ceil`].
/// - **Saturating Sequence Arithmetic**: Non-financial ledger calculations use [`saturating_add`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.u32.html#method.saturating_add).
/// - **Guarded Invariant Subtractions**: State reductions require strict preceding inequality guards.
